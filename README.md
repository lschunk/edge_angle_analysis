# edge_angle_analysis
This repository contains data and analysis related to the edge angles of artefacts from three archaeological sites: Balver Höhle, 
Buhlen and Ramioul. The data was derived from 3D models and then by means of algorithms and scripts (Python and GOM Inspect) generated. 
The repository is related to the following monograph: Understanding Middle Palaeolithic asymmetric stone tool design and use. Functional analysis and controlled experiments to assess Neanderthal technology. Verlag des Römisch- Germanischen Zentralmuseums Mainz, 2022. https://doi.org/10.11588/propylaeum.1076
